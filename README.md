# dot-files

This repository contains my dot files for my personal setup.

It should automatically install the dot files in the home directory and if needed install brew and all bundled packages in the Brewfile.

It relies on the following submodules for zsh plugins:

- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [alias-tips](https://github.com/djui/alias-tips)

## Installation

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
